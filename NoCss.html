<p>Calculate the certainty equivalent of the prospect (0.2,€40;0.6,€50;0.2,€30), under:</p>
<p>a) Expected utility theory with the utility function <em>u(x)=x/10</em> with total wealth=0.</p>
<p>b) Rank dependent utility with the utility function <em>u(x)=x/10</em> and <em>w(p)=p²</em> with total wealth=0.</p>

<h2 id="answer-exercise-1a">Answer Exercise 1a</h2>
<p>The expected value of the prospect is EV=0.2*40+0.6*50+0.2*30=44 and the utility given the formula <em>U(x)=\sum p*u</em> is 4.4.</p>
<p>The certainty equivalent (CE) is calculated by determining the value of x for which an individual is indifferent of receiving the prospect or a certain amount. In this case, since utility is given by <em>U(x)=x/10</em> the CE is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><em>U(x)= x/10 = 4.4</em></p>
<p><em>x = 4.4*10 = 44 = CE</em></p>
<br />

<h2 id="answer-exercise-1b">Answer Exercise 1b</h2>
<p>The rank dependent utility calculated using <em>U(x)=\sum \pi*u</em> and <em>w(p)=p²</em> is as follows: 0.2²*4 + (0.8²-0.2²)*5 + (1-0.8²)*3 = 4.24.</p>
Given that the utility is calculated as <em>u(x)=0.1*x</em>, so the amount for which an individual would be indifferent between the prospect or a certain amount would be CE=4.24/0.1=42.2<br />
