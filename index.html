<h1 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h1>
<p>Calculate the certainty equivalent of the prospect (0.2,€40;0.6,€50;0.2,€30), under:<br />
a) Expected utility theory with the utility function u(x) = x/10, with total wealth=0.<br />
b) Rank dependent utility with the utility function u(x) = x/10 and w(p) = p2, with total wealth=0.</p>
<h2 id="answer-exercise-1a">Answer Exercise 1a</h2>
<p>The expected value of the prospect is EV=0.2*40+0.6*50+0.2*30=44 and the utility given the formula <span class="math inline"><em>U</em>(<em>x</em>)=∑<em>p</em> * <em>u</em></span> is 4.4. The certainty equivalent (CE) is calculated by determining the value of x for which an individual is indifferent of receiving the prospect or a certain amount. In this case, since utility is given by <span class="math inline">$U(x)=\frac{x}{10}$</span> the CE is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\label{simple_equation}
U(x)=\frac{x}{10}=4.4
x=4.4*10=44=CE$$</span><br /></p>
<h2 id="answer-exercise-1b">Answer Exercise 1b</h2>
<p>The rank dependent utility calculated using <span class="math inline"><em>U</em>(<em>x</em>)=∑<em>π</em> * <em>u</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>w</em>(<em>p</em>)=<em>p</em><sup>2</sup></span> is as follows: <span class="math inline">0.2<sup>2</sup> * 4 + (0.8<sup>2</sup> − 0.2<sup>2</sup>)*5 + (1 − 0.8<sup>2</sup>)*3 = 4.24</span>. Given that the utility is calculated as u(x)=0.1*x , so the amount for which an individual would be indifferent between the prospect or a certain amount would be 4.24/0.1=42.4=CE</p>
